package mockstruct

// Placeholder for mock-struct tests.
// See Issue #44: Struct as dependency (mock a struct's methods)
//
// When implemented, this will test:
// - impgen mocks all methods of a struct type
// - Works similar to interface mocking
// - User can control all struct method behaviors
