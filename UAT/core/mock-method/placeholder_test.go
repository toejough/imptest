package mockmethod

// Placeholder for mock-method tests.
// See Issue #45: Struct method as dependency (mock single method by signature)
//
// When implemented, this will test:
// - impgen extracts method signature from struct
// - Generates mock for that signature
// - User can control method behavior in tests
