the example for passing exact data in is incorrect - we pass data in through callable wapper "Start" functions and
callback "invoke" functions right now. "ExpectArgsAre" is another way we receive exactly.

I also want to implement matchers for panics, to unify that with the return value matchers.

I don't think blocking/timeouts need to be expressly discussed in the outcome dimensions. 

Handling concurrency should be called out somewhere - what are the conditions under which we use "Within"?

For returned interfaces and functions, as well as for interfaces and functions passed in to dependencies, are they ok to
be independently wrapped/mocked, or should we have a mechanism for bringing them into the same response channel
ecosystem? As in, if a dependency returns a function, I think we should be able to ask the callable imp what it's next
call is and get that returned function's imp. Similarly, if we pass a callback and then return from the main function,
and then the callback is called... should we be able to test for that with some kind of unified imp?
